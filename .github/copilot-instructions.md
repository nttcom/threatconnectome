## Code Review Guidelines

When performing a code review, respond in Japanese.

When performing a code review, if the UI contains Japanese text, verify that the terminology is consistent with IPA (Information-technology Promotion Agency) standard terminology. Reference URLs: https://www.ipa.go.jp/shiken/kubun/sc.html and https://www.ipa.go.jp/security/index.html
If the terminology is consistent with the standard terminology, explicitly state that no issues were found.
