    - Refer to [this document](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup?hl=en#initialize_the_sdk_in_non-google_environments) to download the JSON file that service account private key.

### Set up production environment variables

In the default configuration, the test server links to the development API running on `localhost` and the build links to the production API.
To change this so that builds also link to the development environment API, the following must be done in advance.

> ```bash
> cd ./web
> cp .env.production.example .env.production.local
> vi .env.production.local  # set values
> ```

:warning: **Values that need to be changed**

- `REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL`
  - Set it as `http://localhost:<your_port_for_threatconnectome>/api` for local development
- Values can be referred from firebase project setting page

  - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
    - The same with `FIREBASE_API_KEY` in ../.envenv
  - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
    - App ID
  - Values can be referred from `firebaseConfig` on the page

    - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
    - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`
    - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
    - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
    - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`

  - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_SAML_PROVIDER_ID`
    - Set your saml provider id if needed.
  - `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_EMULATOR_URL`
    - Set it to `http://localhost:<your_port_for_firebase>`

### Database settings

`docker-compose-prod.yml` is for public environment. Parts that have been commented out, are depending on whether the firebase local emulator is needed to be deplyed or not.
If enabled, it will be the same as `docker-compose-local.yml`, and firebase local emulator will be in use.

- Please use `docker-compose-local.yml` for local development.

### CORS settings (Optional)

Change CORS settings in [main.py](/api/app/main.py), if needed.

### Firebase authentication emulator

You can use the firebase emulator as an authentication platform for testing or running locally.
The `./firebase` directory contains files for the firebase emulator. Place `.firebaserc` of your firebase project directly under this directory.

If you need more information about `.firebaserc` , please refer to the official documents:
https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli/targets

### Web UI

```bash
cd ./web
npm ci
npm run build  # to build what is specified in package.json
```

## :sparkles: Get Started to Threatconnectome

### Run Docker Compose

Start Docker Compose and check that the system is operating normally.

> For local development environmrnt:

```bash
cd ..
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up -d --build  # to start containers
```

And set up database if it is the first time to start.

```bash
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yml exec api sh -c "cd app && alembic upgrade head"
```

### Log in to Web UI

Access `http://localhost:<your_port_for_threatconnectome>`to see Web UI.
Click `Sign up` to create a new account.

### Log in to API

Access `http://localhost:<your_port_for_threatconnectome>/api/docs ` to see API Documents.
Open `auth/token Login For Access Token` on API page, and click `Try it out` on the right.
Fill in username and password created at Web UI, copy `access_token` in Response Body, and paste it into value area of `Authorize` to complete the authentication.

## :people_holding_hands: Create a team

In Threatconnectome, if a user doesn't belong to any team, basic operations cannot be operated (tag management, invitation creation etc.).
To create a team, please follow the procedures below:

1. After the authentication mentioned above (Log in to API), access `http://localhost:<your_port_for_threatconnectome>/api/docs#/pteams/create_team_teams_post` or scroll down to `teams` ⇨ `POST /pteams Create Team` on API page.
2. Click `Try it out`.
3. Modify the content in `Request body`, change `team_name` from `string` to `your team name`.
4. Click `Execute`.
5. Information, including your team id and name, will be shown in `Response body` below.

:warning: Attention: Authentication is necessary before the team creation.

### Stop of Threatconnectome

Stop Docker Compose from running.

> For local development environmrnt:

```bash
sudo docker compose -f docker-compose-local.yml down
```

## :wrench: Troubleshooting

### Unable to log in via Web UI

You need to check the API connection point.
If you are using the API container for the development environment, check that the API container is running properly by running `$ sudo docker compose ps` or by communicating to `http://localhost:<your_port_for_threatconnectome>/api/docs`.

### Troubleshooting with container not running

If certain container is restarting or unhealthy, please add the name of the container after `$ sudo docker compose logs`
For example, if api is restarting, error can be targeted by:

```bash
$ sudo docker compose logs api  # -f option is to follow log output
```

### Unable to successfully build Web UI

Installation of dependent packages may have failed.
Remove `./web/node_modules` directory and try installing again.

## For developer

### Set up development environment variables of Web UI

If you want to define development environment variables, do the following

```bash
cd ./web
cp .env.development.example .env.development.local
vi .env.development.local  # set values
```

If you want to run it, please type the following command

```bash
cd ./web
npm run start  # to check operation and launch the >webpage when developing Web UI
```

## :test_tube: Testing

### test api

Start Docker containers for test and run api test.

```bash
sh testapi.sh
```

docker-compose-test.yml is the config file for testing.
