1. Run a full scan on all directories

```bash
sudo trivy fs -f cyclonedx -o trivy-result.json /
```

2. Upload Sbom file via Web UI

Login to `http://threatconnectome.metemcyber.ntt.com` and choose your team.
(In the case of public environment, for local environment use `http://localhost:<your_port_for_threatconnectome>`)
Navigate to the `Status` page and select `upload` tab. Then drag & drop the `trivy-result.json` file you created to the "Drop SBOM file here" area.

# :bulb: Vuln Registration from TrivyDB

Purpose: To create vulns from TrivyDB to understand the threat impact of your packages.

## :pushpin: Requirements

```bash
pip install boltdb requests
```

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Usage

Run the following commands to update trivy.db

```bash
trivy image --download-db-only

```

The default path of `trivy.db` is as follows:

- Linux: `~/.cache/trivy/db/trivy.db`
- macOS: `~/Library/Caches/trivy/db/trivy.db`

Run the following commands to create vulns from Trivy DB:

The value of SYSTEM_API_KEY should match the value specified in the SYSTEM_API_KEY environment variable when starting the Threatconnectome.

```bash
export THREATCONNECTOME_REFRESHTOKEN="XXXXXXXXX"
export SYSTEM_API_KEY="XXXXXXXXX"
# For local development environment
python3 trivydb2tc.py -d ~/.cache/trivy/db/trivy.db "http://localhost/api"

```

Use `--force-update` option to update existing vulns.

```bash
python3 trivydb2tc.py -d ~/.cache/trivy/db/trivy.db --force-update "http://localhost/api"

```

# :bulb: Vuln Update from Vulnrichment

Purpose: To update vulns from Vulnrichment to regist exploitation and automatable in vuln.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Usage

Run the following commands to clone vulnrichment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cisagov/vulnrichment

```

Run the following commands to update vulns from vulnrichment:

The value of SYSTEM_API_KEY should match the value specified in the SYSTEM_API_KEY environment variable when starting the Threatconnectome.

```bash
export THREATCONNECTOME_REFRESHTOKEN="XXXXXXXXX"
export SYSTEM_API_KEY="XXXXXXXXX"
# For local development environment
python3 vulnrichment2tc.py -v vulnrichment "http://localhost/api"

```

# :bulb: Colletct tickets data

Run the following commands to collect tickets data

```bash
export THREATCONNECTOME_REFRESHTOKEN="XXXXXXXXX"
# For local development environment
python3 collect_tickets_data.py -p <pteam_id> -s <service_id> "http://localhost/api"

```

# :bulb: Safety impact registration from ImpactEstimator

Run the following commands to register the safety impact

```bash
export THREATCONNECTOME_REFRESHTOKEN="XXXXXXXXX"
# For local development environment
python3 impact_estimator2tc.py -d <tickets_data> -s <safety_impact> -p <process_safety_impact> "http://localhost/api"
```
